FILTER FUNCTIONALITY
.when user checks a type box, we want to return only pokemons that have that type
.each pokemon has 1 or 2 types, but no more
.if the user clicks on 2 checkboxes, we want to return only pokemons that have both those types as their types
.if the user clicks on a checkbox that is checked, we want to uncheck it and remove that type as a filter (though a pokemon can still have that type if it is the other type a pokemon has besides the other filter type)
.if there are two types already selected and the user clicks on a third type checkbox, there are 2 options for how to handle it...
    1.  replace the the type that was selected first with the new one
    2.  disable any future clicks until the user deselects one of the existing types.   this option may require some feedback to the user to let them know they must deselect a type...perhaps disable all the others?
.there needs to be component level state in the TypeMenu to keep track of the number of checkboxes clicked
